## Prometheus
- Install prometheus : brew install prometheus
- Start prometheus: brew services start prometheus
- Prometheus web url : http://localhost:9090
- **Node exporter**:
   - The Node Exporter is an agent that gathers system metrics and exposes them in a format which can be ingested by Prometheus.
   - **Data Model**:
     - Stores data as time series.
     - Time-series data represents information that changes over time and is sampled at specific points in time (depending on when exactly Prometheus will be pulling metrics from its targets). 
     - Time series has Metric name and Labels.
     - Each label is a Key/Value pair.
     - <metric name>{Key=value, key=value,..}
  - **Data types**:
    - ***Scalar*** - Float or String
       - Store => prometheus_http_request_total{code=200, job=prometheus} (Both values are stored as String)
       - Query - prometheus_http_request_total{code=~"2.*", job="prometheus"} => This will work as both code and job are String.
       - Query - prometheus_http_request_total{code=200, job="prometheus"} => this will not work as code is not Float but String.
    - **Instant Vectors**: (https://medium.com/@ahmed.s.farag96/decoding-promql-unraveling-range-vectors-and-instant-vectors-in-prometheus-c1390f650e5c)
       - From its name, it basically gives you an instant in time for the metrics values (the last scrapped value for each metric to be specific, as shown in the diagram below)
    - **Range Vectors**
       -  It gives us metrics values within the specified time range.
